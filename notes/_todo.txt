Struct todo:

- expand to fix width of window when too small to display 2 columns
  - MORE GENERAL: expand last column to fit remaining window space

column colors
detect if browser compatibility, show error if needed

theme changes disappear on reload

renaming root Notes causes new one to be created, need a separate identifier

	- to help with lazy slots, add method:
		- Slot copyValueFromInstanceTo(anInstance, otherInstance) - which checks for lazy slot and avoids load
		- remove oneShotGetter to avoid complexity of undoing it
			
	- if a node is lazy, what happens when it's persisted?
	  - we don't want that to force a load
	
	- storage issue:
	  - if we change shouldStore, we need to mark all objects referencing it to dirty
	  - if we change shouldStoreSubnodes, we need to mark object as dirty
	  
	move addSubnode overrides -> addSubnodeAt
	- change overrides to use didAddSubnode() 
	- add didReplaceSubnode(), didRemoveSubnode()?
	
	- take a look at shouldStore slot 
	- should it have a Slot object?

	- add Slot initOp (nop, null, copy, duplicate)
	
	- remove BMFieldSetNode?

	- add a style for active selection?
	
	- hit enter to follow a UrlNode
		
	- feature: way to split or merge two TextArea nodes
	
	- if drop fails, return to source path if possible
	
	note icon not working on fields

	- IMPORTANT: support subtitle under key on FieldView

	- avoid BrowserRow justTap when clicking on Textfields within BrowserRow

	- bug: d key to drag not working on Safari

	- need to disable row (or all?) gestures while textfield is editing to prevent interfering with click-drag selection

	- how to support returns in TextField without all the other junk
	
	- support subtitle subnode count suffix?
	- move summary suffix to subtitle suffix?
	- add subtitle prefix?
	
	- rerender of node subtitle not occuring when subnodes reordered...
	
	bug when turning off summary - stil has weird subtitle value
	
	move to actions on down key instead of up key so key repeat can work

	deleting a row not clearing next column <<<

	- Textfield needs to allow tap propogation and selection of it's row, while still holding onto focus
		options?:
		
		syncFromNode calling didClickRow updating selection?
		
		BrowserRow
		completeTap
		justTap
		Column onRequestSelectionOfRow  
		Column didClickRow(aRow)
        this.browser().selectColumn(this)
		

		- separate internal selection of column row from UI selection of column row?
		- hack: don't focus if subview is focused?
			- before allowing Column onFocus, see if subview is focused?
		- some sort of requestFocus from current firstResponder View?
		- have columns support isSelected? selection path so back arrow pops a level?
			- onSelect on Row, could focus default subview - such as value text field?
		

	Support for Font drop:
	var fontFace = new FontFace(family, source, descriptors);

	SoundField?
	MovieField?
	UnitsNode Weight, Measures, Currencies
	AddressNode, CityNode, PostalCode, MapNode

	make sure uses of setSubnodes don't break mutation observations on subnodes array

	- support for Coalescing didMutate messages to end of event loop?

	- bug: need to prevent data from changing subnodes while editing inspector

	node inspector:
		- note: default, is subnode count
		- subtitle: default, is children summary
		- self summary: 
			- suffix:
				- default
				- new line
				- text [ ]
			>>>>>>>> support option return for new line?

	- todo: select all when tabbing to next field value
	
	- summary is subnode count doesn't seem to work??
	
	Field
	- support subtitle (make subtitle of key, and key is title)
	
	change summary joiner to be per node

	bug: Node note as subnode count isn't working
	
	Support summary value that includes embedded images?
	
	
	After dropping group of images, deleting several image field views produces a missing parent exception
	
	multi-touch via mouse not working?

	backspace is getting captured by row when editing a text area
	Fade out loading screen
		
	animate collapsing of columns?
	
	Unable to open inspector on Number or String fields
		
	Menu child summary not working right when subnode is an Options (e.g. shows "Option Title")

	Change no match to return undefined for search methods
	
	animate failed drop slide back to original location?
	
	Column, if selected node has no subnodes and can't add subnodes, don't open it when selected

	desiredWidth is too expensive - we need a way to support larger columns
	- set max-width to width of browser
	- don't set min-width?
	- setup subnodes and then ask column for clientWidth?

	support for NodeView that register to handle drop mime types
	- e.g. ColumnView onBrowserDrop of image might create a ImageWellFieldRowView
	- Class canOpenMimeType (s) 
	- NodeView allSubclasses ().decect(aClass => aClass.canOpenMimeType(mimeType))
	
	delete gesture doesn't work on rows in single column mode

	shift/command? up/down arrow to jump to top/bottom of navigation rows
	- shift back arrow to return to root
	
	After moving a field in a JsonArray to a JsonDict, it doesn't make the keys visible
	don't limit expand on hover to droppable items in case decendants can accept it
		
	Rename allSlots to allSlotsDict
	
	When Browser in single column mode, can get stuck in showing empty columns
	- after it stops showing back arrow?
	
	UnitsNode - OptionsNode with 
	
	Have NumberField support units and unit abbrieviations? Conversions?
		
	way on keyboard to add to column even if it's empty
	NumberField validation not working?

	Inspector menus
	- support inspectorPath attribute on Slot

	Themes

		Redo themes themeName -> sectionName -> 
			default, selected, activated, error
			row padding, padding between row components
		

		use from View:

			bg = currentTheme().section("field").section("value").backgroundColor()
			bg = currentTheme().valueForPath("field/key/backgroundColor")
			bg = currentTheme().valueForPath("field/value/backgroundColor")
			bg = currentTheme().valueForPath("field/topBottomPadding")
			(section() returns default section if not found)
	
			if field/value/backgroundColor not found, defaults to
			field/backgroundColor, which if not found defaults to
			backgroundColor
			
			sections are create-path-on-attribute-write
			- change path sections from shouldStore false to true on attribute write
			Section - tellParents("didWriteAttribute")
			
			
	ProgressView?

	Allow Option nodes to (optionally) have subnodes?
	- example:
		Date -> Format -> Specific Years [ ] -> Start Year, End Year
                       -> Current Year Range [ ] -> plus range, minus range

	RangeNode 
	- has two subnodes of the same type
	- enforces 1st value <= 2nd value 
	- need a value node protocol with methods like (compare(other), increment, decrement)

	if slots are set in initPrototype, they can get overwritten during init via the slots initSlot
	- check to make sure classes aren't setting values in initPrototype
	
	rename didInit to something better - like didCompleteInit
	
	add Object.prepareToRetire 
	- remove from watching for notifications, events, etc - remove subviews? from from parent view?
	
	bug: some divClassNames seem to contain two of the same class names
	

	justTap and willAcceptFirstResponder both call requestSelection which calls onRequestSelection 
	- we probably don't want to get this message twice


	Have Number field deal with commas and european points

	For TextView
		white-space: pre
	    word-wrap: wrap;
	

	Boolean and ImageWell fields are appearing as String fields
	
	Too many syncFromNode's being sent to views
	- example: Browser sync tells ColumnGroup and Column to sync, but also set's their node, 
	- setting the node itself schedules syncFromNode 
	
	Browser navigation not always collapsing left columns as needed when navigating far right
	- seems to happen only on menu nodes - are they capturing some event or not sending a change note?
	
	Slot
	- on get slot attribute, if value is InheritedValue, lookup in superPrototype's slot
	- all overridden slot attributes are set to InheritedValue
	

	ShelfNode for left column
	- makes all dropped items into links
	- when dragging links, it maps the drag operation as if it had been done directly

	SliderField - present if Slot is Number and isInteger
	
	Slot isInteger validRange=[start, end]
	
	compact top header when not needed
	
	
	TopShelfView
	TopShelfNode
	Grid of short row size spots
	
	OptionsNode -> validValuesPrototypeName
	
	OptionsPicker that uses a link (a path?) to a prototype to find it's validValues
	
	Text -> inspector -> themes options -> themes prototype  

	ColorField
		
	ColorFieldView
	
	tap-delete-key once to open delete menu (as if by gesture) and then return to complete or any other key to cancel

	JsonDictionary - auto unique name new items?
	- add error to item if key isn't unique
	
	properly hide key in Field (so JSON values look better)
	- better JSON view for Booleans and Null?
	
	fix ImageWell drop

	add slot setter checks for SlotType and validValues

	when adding a Boolean, String, Number, Date, Null to JsonArray, turn off show key
	
	Inpector on JsonArray, JsonDict that supports transformations
	- auto detect which classes can read the json type, present as options?
	- ability to map field names for classes that can read json?
	- select class -> show class field names -> select field name -> show available json field names and self?
	
	
	
	BMFolderNode option to allow subtitle to be edited
	
	ImageWell forgetting image

	tap-tap-hold for link
	
	move BMNode.note to visibleNote so noteIsSubnodeCount() etc is separated from stored value

	- need a type of NodeLink that links to a proto and when duplicated, 
	  duplicates that proto instead of just linking to it
	  
	  NodeLink
	  - willDuplicateLinkedObject slot
	  
	  - need a gesture for dragging a link
		  - hold-drag = move
		  - tap-hold-drag = copy
		  - tap-tap-hold-drag = link
	  
	  - some way to create a set of menu nodes with a range of names

	- move allSlots to allSlotEntries so we can keep them ordered
	
	- Slot properties: 
		- isInspectable
		- something like rootSubnodeWithTitleForProto

	- support accepts subnode drop onto link node
	
	Notes: 
	Underlying datastructure for Hypercard and spreadsheets, are tables.
	Hypercard has customized row editors and is focused on search, 
	while spreadsheets are focused on calculation. 
		
	Prototypes
		- Primitives
		- 3rd Party
		- Custom
		
	Have CreatorNode add prototypes to list?
	
	Have row.desiredWidth include subtitle?
	add inspector to choose how row desiredWidth calculated - use elipsis if title/subtitle cut off 
	
	DateNode needs inspector & fix weird subnodes - are they being stored?
		- set year range
		- option to display age?
		- options on subtitle stuff
	
	replace node label slots with title overrides?

	have reorder cause parent nodes to re-render
	
	PointerField vs LinkNode?
	
	Row delete X in wrong position?
	
	disable row view gestures while Text is being edited

	unify node->view sync and node->store sync?
		
	simplify getter/setter hooks?

	If a lazy ref can be on a network store, should we move to supporting
	fully async local store too?
		- we have didInit and didLoadFromStore, but we'll need more ways of 
		making upper level looks into lower level async?
	Better to make remote store fully synchronous for now.
	

	get drag in/out of browser copy working again
	
	unify willGetSlotName by moving it into Slot? remove from ProtoClass

	//add name caching for willGetSlot, didGetSlotName
	make sure all _privateName = are preceeded by instance init that calls defineSlot
	
	move detect (and other map ops) to use undefined where more appropriate than null

	Update Volunutary site to say project is on hold.
	Move Notepad repo.
	Come up with Notepad/Sketchpad name
     
	have SlotGroup which manages privateName, getter, and setter?
	move Slot/slots into base Object? How to ensure init is called? Do we want it called on all Arrays, etc?
	
	
	
	add shouldSelfTest to Object prototype to support runnign all tests?
	
	FINALIZATION

		// called on all objects
		- scheduleDidInit // Object just calls didInit(), BMNode schedules didInit
		- didInit

		- didLoadFromStore

		- scheduleDidLoadFromStore
		- didLoadFromStore
		
		
	CONSIDER
	support unloading lazy references? Subnodes array should only ever be 
	referenced by owner node, so it's always safe to unload it
	how to remove from activeObjects unless we can be sure no references are held?
	Store.activeObjectsReferencingObject(anObject), using refPids
	BMNode.unloadSubnodesIfPossible
	
	
	TIMESTAMPS
	every record has write ts/timeStamp? Should ts be stored in object or is it store dependent?
	Hold ts only in record. Ask store for *it's* ts for a record.

	change semantics of willGetSlot etc to pass slot instead of slot name
	
	RANDOM proxy rebroadcaster? posts any message sent to it (supports list of valid messages?)

 cleanup prepare for first access
	
	OPTIMIZATION
	- move creation of unhooked_ slots to Array 
	- and implement it's methods using unhooked methods with calls to will+didMutate?
	- implement a doMutation(aClosure) that pauses mutation callbacks and calls will/didMutate?

	ELEGANCE
	- cleaner way to handle lazySubnodesCount?
		- have storeRef able to access Record properties?
		- Array.lengthForRecord(this.ownSlotNamed("subnodes").storeRef().record())?
		
	FEATURES
	Slot type checking setTypeCheck(aClassName)
	- copy slots?
	
	
	- remove old BMNode sorting code
	- with BMNode subnode observer, no longer need didChangeSubnodeList calls?
	
	- merge BMFieldSetNode with BMNode?
	
	- find how Theme and other stuff is getting into Storage

	- work on didUpdateNode notifications - coalesce?

	- asReadOnly method on array with returns ReadOnlyArray Copy
	bug: row title / subtitle are sometimes clipped
	
	take a close look at .overrideSlot() calls
	replace "delete a[i]" with a.removeAt(i)
	replace "a[i] = v" with atPut(i, v)

	- replace old subnode hooks? 
		- have subnodes array notify node of mutation?
		- needed to notify views?
			
	- fix reordering via drag and drop
			
	- review this.overrideSlot("title"...

	- have auto getter/setters check and call super?

	change use of "slot" to mean Slot object and replace other uses (e.g. newSlots) with "property"
	
	need to add stored field in initPrototype and then instantiate it in init?

	
	Field issues:
	
		- initPrototype
			- add slot
				- set to shouldStore
				- set initInstance // fields aren't an initInstance - the value is stored in the slot, field is a subnode
					- init and setup Field
		- init
			- Slot.onInstanceInitSlot
				- init new instance of field
				- add new instance as subnode ???
		
	

	Change Observation target to sender
	
	mode onDidEditNode and other parent messages to have parents listen to subnodes
	
	ConstructorA
		.prototype -> PrototypeA
						constructor -> ConstructorA
						__proto__ -> Object?
						slots =
						
	
	
	- add store check to make sure only one commit is done per event loop?
				
	cleanup shared to use typeClass
	
	NodeStore:
		Remove global _ roots and replace with a single root Node.
	
	BMNode
		- need to support array and dict values on slots which can reference nodes
		  so we can implement Store.pidRefsFromNodeDict
		
		- differences between copy and store?

	- fix for BooleanFieldView tab action
	
	dragging
		issues:
			- interfering with gestures
		solution:
			- require special key (C?) to turn on BrowserRow drag out of browser? 
				- turn on listen to keyboard
					- on_C_KeyDown, turn on register for dragging
					- on_C_KeyUp, turn off dragging
		
	
	copying
	- would be nice to unify store, copy, drag-to-json
		issues:
		- what about auto scheduling sync to NodeStore (only do this on StorableNode?)
	

	BrowserColumn.onDragDestinationDropped
	- change to insert dropped node and sync instead of inserting view and syncing to node? 

	add canCopy option?

	support copy and link drag
	
	long press + option = two finger long press?
	- mapping of certain keys to more fingers?
	
	copying an object
	
	StorableNode -> SummaryNode -> FolderNode
                                   OptionsNode
								   
								   
	- way to present errors in summary (set a message on top node that's presented if any lower nodes have error)
	- way to clear values in all lower nodes
	- top node default message for all lower nodes cleared?
	
	
	Prototypes
	- way to link a top node to it's prototype
	- special stored property SvStorableNode.viewPrototype
								  	
	
	
	should text fields be html?
	
	
	- Inspector 
		- have view inform node when it can stop caching inspector node?
		- some form of retain/release?
		- ask NotificationCenter if anyone is watching?
		- have NotificationCenter send message when watch count goes to zero?
		
	- ComputedValueNode
		- can type equation that can access sibiling or parent slots for variables
		
	- OptionNode
		- if single selection jump back on activing
	- TextNode store isSelectable
		- FolderNode store wantsRestOfWidth or wantsFillWidth?

	- bug: undefined showing up for notes in Peer app
	- bug row content view 1px less height than row?
	
	- how to use nodes for viewStyles? Color?
		- ISSUE: both nodes and views need view styles
		- ISSUE: loop: viewStyle node needs a viewStyle
		- SOLUTION: like Nodes can have inspectors - create on access?
		- NOTE: have viewStyles which can point to others for inheritance?

    Drag/Drop Protocol

        TODO
            - automate Node scheduleSyncToStore instead of making views responsible?
            - look into "selectThisColumn WARNING: this.browser() === null"
            - don't allow views to change node?
            
        BUG
        
            - do we need to syncFromNode for all tellParentViews("didEditNode")?
                - was this from before didUpdateNode notifications?
                - probably can stop at first level responsible for syncing with node?
            
        - navigate left when holding over left side?

        - finish dragging operation type support (link, copy, move)
        - finish protocol to accept type of view/node and type of operation
          - acceptsDropFrom(dragView) // check type and action?

   Drop Protocol
   
            
            DragView
                item  // view being dragged
                source // view from which the drag item is coming (implements dragging source protocol)
                destinationView (set before completion)
                
            - have dragging view set a sourceView on DraggingView (usually it's parent)
            - send different messages to sourceView than other hoverViews
            
            
            Responsibilities:
            
                item:
                    - get long press that starts drag
                    - setup DraggingView with item, sourceView
                    - pass initial event to setup DraggingView pan
                
                DragView:
                    - send all protocol messages to item, source, destination
                    - animate move to final position or slideback
                    
                sourceView:
                    - open place holder

                destination/hover Views
                
                    if it just needs to react to hover (e.g. row):
                        - selects self
                    
                    if it accepts drop (e.g. column): 
                        - open place holder on enter 
                        - move placeholder on hover
                        - remove placeholder on exit
                        - replace placeholder with view on complete

            start:
                on source:
                    - hide dragging view, replace with PlaceHolder

                - else
                    - remove PlaceHolder and dragging view from source
                    - replace PlaHolder with dragging view in destination
                        - move node into destination node

- demo for making diagrams
    DiagramView
    
    
- add 
    - a just text area row
    - title row?

- replace Win/Window point APIs with Viewport? Move all to Document points?
    - have EventPoint use document(?) coordinates and implement asViewPortPoint, asDocumentPoint, asPointInView(aView)

Bugs:
    - source row reappears in source when dragged over not drop area
    
    - row moving during placeholder index change isn't covering row width
    - long-click drag is causing text selections
        - google it - how to override click drag? stop propogation of click?
        - keep selection of until tap?


        
        
BrowserRow hover
    - nice animations
        - animate placeholder creation if the column isn't the drag source
        - shrink placeholder to zero if drag is over middle third of a row (that we can drop on?)
        - animate close of source placeholder after drop
        - animate return of dragView to original column on drop cancel?
    
    - how to deal with multiple hover targets that accept drag
    - detect if drag view is on far left/right of browser columns with more columns and back/forward if held there
    
    
Browser
    - support multi-touch, shift-click, and shift-click-drag multi-selection
        - prevent selection nav when doing multi-selection
    - apply long press to whole multi-selection
        - special dragView for multi-selection
    - advanced: support pinch on multi-selection to auto create menu and move selection into it



Inspector
    - test out inspectors on other elements - fields like "shows title"

- make CloseButton a subclass of ButtonView

- cleanup uses of onTapComplete? support onOneFingerTap, onOneFingerDoubleTap, etc?

- event propogation for gestures - separate onTap from onAlternateTap?

ImageWellFieldRowView

column/row features:

- use tab to go to next row

multiple selection?

--------------

need a way to set icon forground colors

turn off arrow key handling by column while editing text field

issue with tap - what if a parent and child view both get a tap?
- how do we implement an event propogation system like click uses?
- option: have request activation check to see if the currently activated view is under the requesting on,
  if so, override it?

BrowserRow title - TextField option for double tap to edit?

MIRROR
Do we need inheritance?

View

- nodeMirror() { 
    const node = this._node
    if (node && node.nodeMirror) {
        return node.nodeMirror()
    }
    return node
}
    
notification didUpdateDodeRowLinkMethods?

OPTION 0
Keep columns unaware that a node was skipped?


OPTION 1
Let the node manage what the column sees?
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA)
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA.visibleNode())

OPTION 2
Let the column manage what the column sees?
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA)
Row (for NodeA) -> select -> Column (for NodeA.visibleNodesOrder()[index])

OPTION 3
Use compacted column to jump?
Node 
- columnCompactsByDefault()
- compactedColumnDefaultSelectedSubnode()

NodeA.defaultColumnNode() (this or some subnode?)

1. advantages - keeps logic on view side
                expand animatations 
                have special button or gesture on row to "uncompact" subnodes
                keeps paths consistent
                
2. disadvantages - need to make Columns navigation aware when it should skip the compacted columns

Will most nodes be "compacted"?
Can we skip creating that view entirely? If so, just special case paths?


NODES -> RowViews

Action 
Boolean
Date
Image
Menu (title, subtitle)
Number (range, format, useSlider?) 
Options 
Pointer
TextField
TextArea
Color

-----------

**Fields**
- make statefull and have them sync with parent nodes if they have targetGetter/setters (Done?)
BMOptionRow - sends this.parentNode().selectOption(this) when clicked

- a row duplicate feature? (command D? command copy/paste? three finger long press?)

- mode for non white background on fields - persist styles?

- add a default user image, so formatting of messages isn't weird 

- use onShiftClick and two finger long press to inspect a node?

copy/paste style
store/edit style at row prototype level

    Node
        - fields
        - subnodes (short cuts to an array field
        
    A field is a type of node used to represent a property of a node.
    
    Field types:
        Creator     BMCreatorField
        Button      BMActionNode
        Boolean     BMBooleanField  
        Date        BMDateNode
        Text 
        TextArea    BMTextAreaField
        Identity    BMIdentityField
        Number      BMNumberField
        Time
        Options (can point to node containing list of options, or it's own local set?)
        Pointer
        Array
        Method?

-- Dragging from anywhere in window
	- standard long press with 2-3 fingers to drag?
	- ask if target allows drag
	- determine type of drag (move/copy) using modifier keys and or finger count?
	- determine how to display drag view - some common standard of icon + label?
	- create drag view and add to DocumentBody(?)
	- add PanGesture to drag view, start panBegin
	- onPanMove calcs new location using PanGesture downPositionInTarget (add helper method for calc?)
	
	Drop areas
	- default to highlight drop area if allowed but can override 

	ColumnBrowser onDrop
	- check if allows drop and specific drop type
	- create empty browser row 
	- pause syncing from model

- support multi BrowserRow selection

-------------------------

select all text on double touch tap

copy / paste /duplicate rows?

    Hierarchical Column view


    Grid Browser Column

-------------------------------------

    - support multi BrowserRow selection 
        - UI interaction?
            - mouse: hold command or shift and click
            - touch: hold one item and tap on or slide across others?

    -- ability to switch dark/light theme

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Browser features:  
        - copy/paste on rows?
        - double tap to inline edit row text?
        - pinch apart to add row?
        - tap on column to add row?
        - stretch to add row?

    How to expand/compact Node to edit properties?
      - icons at top? gesture? 
         - hold click on top? 
         - hold click on column divider?
         - horizontal pinch apart columns - pinch together to compact?  
         - how to visually display option to edit?

    TopShelf vs LeftShelf? TopDragShelf?
    - compact/expand top shelf?

    Small fixes:
    - figure out when to use white/dark theme on rows consistently
    - use dark for non property navigation?

    Editing a Node:
    - when adding row, insert a special place-holder row and navigate into it
      next column shows options for which type of row to add, navigate to choice
      further options and "ok" displayed to complete action?
    - how to edit an existing row? special click to navigate to it's options?

    - some way to collapse/expand Node to show all properties or treat some default as it's subnodes? 

    Questions:
    - How to distinguish meta edit operations? 
    - When is it normal or meta?
